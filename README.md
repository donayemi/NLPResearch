## Overview

**NLPResearch** is a project focused on analyzing the discourse around Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education over the last five years. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how AI is framed in educational research and policy, identifying key themes, trends, and sentiment within the field.

## Research Questions

- **How have dominant themes and research priorities in AI applications in education evolved over the last 5 years, and what emerging trends are shaping the future of AI in educational settings?**
- **What are the prevailing sentiment trends in AI-related educational research and policy, and how do they reflect the broader perceptions of AI’s potential and challenges within the educational community?**

## Research Goals

- Identify dominant themes within AI-related educational research, including areas such as ethics, adaptive learning technologies, and assessment automation.
- Reveal how AI is utilized in various educational contexts, highlighting issues, opportunities, and challenges.
- Track shifts in research focus over time, mapping the progression and anticipating future developments in AI and education.
- Analyze sentiment trends to understand broader perceptions of AI in education.

## Analysis Workflow

Thematic findings and textual data will undergo a structured preprocessing and analysis workflow:

1. **Preprocessing**
    - **Tokenization:** Breaks text into individual words or tokens.
    - **Stopword Removal:** Eliminates common words (e.g., "the", "is") that do not contribute meaningful information.
    - **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their root form for consistency.
    - These steps ensure the textual data is clean and normalized, improving the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

2. **Computational Text Analysis**
    - **Topic Modeling:** Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify dominant themes and trends.
    - **Sentiment Analysis:** Categorizes texts as positive, neutral, or negative to gauge perception of AI’s role.
    - **Keyword & N-gram Analysis:** Detects frequently occurring words and multi-word phrases, revealing common discussion points and terminologies.
    - **Trend Analysis:** Maps how AI-related topics (e.g., ethics, personalization, automation) have evolved over time.

3. **Visualization**
    - **Word Clouds:** Highlight prominent and frequently occurring terms.
    - **Trend Graphs:** Illustrate thematic shifts and changes over the years.
    - **Topic Networks:** Map relationships between recurring concepts and themes.

## Methods Summary

- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization
- **Analysis:** LDA topic modeling, sentiment analysis, keyword/N-gram analysis, trend analysis
- **Visualization:** Word clouds, trend graphs, topic network diagrams

## Insights for Stakeholders

This project aims to provide valuable insights for:
- **Researchers:** Understanding the evolution and current state of AI in education.
- **Educators:** Identifying opportunities and challenges presented by AI technologies.
- **Policymakers:** Informing policy decisions with a detailed overview of trends and perceptions in the field.
